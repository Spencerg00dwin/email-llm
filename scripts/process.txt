Delete a JSON cell (email):
1. Calendar invite
2. Forwarded message


Delete end of message:
1. Email signature
    - The problem with this is when you have an email chain it there's a gap between the messages.
      for instance, we have our email, then the response, then our email again. So on and so forth.
      I'm deciding to make the sacrifice and delete the messages after the first signature.
